A module to interact phone's infrared sensors (IR).

https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/31459#issuecomment-2351376833

WORKAROUND
I followed this steps to get the module project running:

npx create-expo-module expo-settings
crash happens
open the file path/to/your/projects/expo-settings/node_modules/expo-module-scripts/bin/npx with text editor
change file content to:
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Runs `npx` through Yarn if necessary so that the environment variables are set up similarly across
# Yarn and npm.

# shellcheck disable=SC2154
npx "$@"
rerun npx create-expo-module expo-settings
confirm with yes the question: The target directory ... is not empty, do you want to continue anyway?
